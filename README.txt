A tool that represents the vertices, edges and angles of a graph. The interface allows 
vertice manipulations by the user and the edges and angles are updated based on them. 
The tool is generalised to work on arbitrary vertex manipulations through updating 
operating on the current vertex positions and not depending on the specific nature of 
manipulation.
